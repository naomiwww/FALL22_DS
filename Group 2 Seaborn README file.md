### Description of Project
This is an analysis and visualization of reasons why and when people call 911. 

### STEP 1: Collecting Data
We collected data from the 911.csv
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mchirico/montcoalert.

### STEP 2: Data Cleaning
We cleaned the data before the analyzing the data and making the graphs.

### STEP 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
1. First we did an analysis on some basic questions. For example, we analyze the top 5 zipcodes and top 5 townships for 911 calls.
Then we analyzed the reason why people call 911 which includes the EMS, Fire, or Traffic.

2. Then we analyzed multiple variables into people calling 911. We analyszed the time of day, which month, the location, and the reason why people call 911.

3. Then we put used that data and made 10 new graphs. We compared the number of calls by reason, highest number of calls by address, highest number of calls by zipcodes, etc.

## GOALS:
Our goal is to reproduce visualizations that compares the data that we collected from the 911.csv. These visualization will make it easier to the audience to understand why people call 911, what time and year and day, and where exactly do people call 911.
